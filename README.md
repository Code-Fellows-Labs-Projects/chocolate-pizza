This was a pair programming assignment to match our webpage as closely as possible to the preview provided. Justin and I were given 4 hours to complete as much of this assignment as possible switching between roles as the driver and navigator.

### Reflections and Comments
Justin and I worked well together as a team. We almost completed the entire lab in 4 hours. The only part we didn't complete was section three and the footer. After our 201 course was over, I went back and completed these sections.
